### Calculate the ideal sample size

Samples too small may lead to inconclusive results,
while too large may have unnecessary costs and risks.
Find the right size with abtester.

### Analyze the statistical significance
In a properly designed A/B test, a difference between the groups is either due to a real effect or to random chance. Calculate the probability of each case and if the difference is statistically significant.
