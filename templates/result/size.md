**{{(s.control_sample + s.treatment_sample)|prettify_number(0)}} is the minimum sample size required.**

To measure with statistical significance a difference of at least {{(100 * i.sensitivity)|prettify_number(1)}}%, between the control and the treatment, the experiment must have no less than this sample size.
